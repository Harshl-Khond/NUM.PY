# 📊 NumPy From Basics to Advanced (Practical)

This repository contains my **complete hands-on learning journey of NumPy**, starting from **basic concepts** to **advanced real-world data analysis projects**.

The focus of this repository is **practical learning**, **vectorized thinking**, and **real-world problem solving using NumPy**.

## 🚀 What I Learned

### 🔹 Level 1 – Basics
- What NumPy is and why it is used
- NumPy arrays (`ndarray`)
- Array creation (`array`, `arange`, `zeros`, `ones`)
- Basic mathematical operations
- Indexing and slicing
- Difference between NumPy arrays and Python lists

---

### 🔹 Level 2 – Intermediate
- 2D & multi-dimensional arrays
- `reshape`, `flatten`, `ravel`
- Axis operations (`axis=0`, `axis=1`)
- Broadcasting
- Sorting and ranking (`sort`, `argsort`, `argmax`)
- Random data generation (`randint`, `seed`)
- Statistical functions (`mean`, `sum`, `std`, `var`, `percentile`)

---

### 🔹 Level 3 – Advanced
- Boolean masking and filtering
- Advanced indexing (row & column selection)
- Vectorization vs Python loops
- Performance-focused NumPy coding
- `np.where()`, `np.clip()`
- Time-series style data analysis
- Real-world data cleaning and analytics
